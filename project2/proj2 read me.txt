Acmes Iowa Housing Project

This is project #2 of the GA data science immersive course, focusing on analyzing the Housing Acmes Iowa set.

The purpose of this project is when to narrow down the features out of the 80 features that actually predict and decide the price of the housing prices based on a test set data .

We are given a test csv data without sales price and a full training csv data set with null values and different ordinal , and features.

1)We cleaned the data
2) Did exploratory data analysis for the data , cleaned null values 
3) We removed the unnecessary columns based on correlation and our EDA.
4) we performed linear regression , Ridge regression and lasso regression to narrow down the features that tested our train set on validationtest set.
5)then we got a model and predicted on our test csv set with a root mean square error of $40000 that predicts the sales price based on a test data set.
6) we thus have 52 features.

7) we then try to reduce the features to 30 by keeping the 30 top correlated features ,and tested the same ridge model on the features on the test set.
8) We then end up finalised with a $35k root mean square error and keeping 30 top features that predict housing sales price.
