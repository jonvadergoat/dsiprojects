40,t3_ipzyv9,I'm about to change your motherfucking life with this knowledge. PSA.,"I'm seeing a level of inconsistency with dude profiles that passes the quirky line and goes straight into *what the fuck were you thinking* territory. Women can also have shit profiles but I'm not a woman so I'll let someone else handle that.

# Let's fix two very fixable things:

# Profile Pictures:

There's five basic pictures all dudes should have of some variation in any order:

* Selfie (only fucking one of these, they need to know who you are, not *\*snap\* \*snap\* biiiiitch I've arrived.)*
* Group shot doing some social thing, preferably with women also in it that aren't ugly. This subconsciously vouches for you not being weird.
* Outdoor shot. They need to know you're into nature and shiiiiiiet. This can be funny or stoic. Fuck idk, you can be on a boat or hanging from a rock. Look cool.
* Pet shot. This can be someone else's pet. Just make sure it's cute and unique. Think shitty Christmas picture where you dress it up in a sweater. Many pets are walkable. No one is going to dislike you taking a duck for a walk.
* Work/Passion shot. This can be you doing some kind of hobby that you do that is socially acceptable. So if you're into fucking skulls but also fly RC planes, put the RC plane shot in. You can have people in it or not, whatever. It's an audible.

# First Dates (whenever shit opens back up, be safe):

Are you tired as shit of trying to figure out what the fuck you want to do? Remember, *Tinder is a numbers game.*

**Why not create a date template first and then run as many women through it as you want?** (*Think of lap times at the track, you can better compare them to each other in similar situations. There are a lot of other bennys to doing this too)*

* *Budgeting:* If the dates are generally the same you can generally have some grasp of how many you can pump out monthly.
* *Data:* Women get flooded DMs. Men should get...idk something. The first date can at least be where you get to make some calls on what you'd like to do and get some information on how people stack up.
* *Confidence:* You might already have this but how cool is it to be able to fully enjoy the moment knowing that you already have an idea of how well the date could go?
* *Illusion of spontaneity:* Women want some spice, some surprise, etc. But that is genuinely much harder to just do on a whim. If at each stage of your date you have 2-3 options of things you can do, depending on context, you can choose one of those things ""because a friend recommended it"", ""I thought about trying this"", idk some fucking reason.
* *Things to do:* This one is big. In my experience women remember dates as like a collage so the more rich density you can pack in that shit, the more you stand out from Dildo Baggins dinner and a movie guy. So the more moments you can comfortably chain together in a date the better.
* *Familiarity*: If you go to the same places enough, some staff may remember you and provide better service, you might get additional perks, etc. I once went to a sushi place every Friday for two months and after the first month they started making me origami vegetables and getting my order ready before I was seated at my regular table. Idk about you but it sets a positive tone if your date sees you getting preferential treatment and taking care of wait staff.
* *Additional dates:* If it goes well enough to warrant another date or two then you should have material to work with already.

You'll figure this out more with experience but the basic premise is that you're going to have some kind of food or coffee or whatever and you're going to need to do some shit.

There are tons of event websites, including FB, for things like cooking classes, live art painting, shows, various performance whatever, tastings, etc. A lot of these things are reoccuring on a weekly or monthly basis so it's a good idea to figure out as much shit as possible that happens during the days you schedule dates for in the event things get cancelled/fall through, etc.

1. Figure out food/wine/dessert/coffee/ingestible options. The more hipster the better.
2. Learn about as many events as you can that happen in your area during the days you'll be scheduling.
3. Be mindful of where those things are in relation to each other. You don't want to spend the entire date getting back in a car for most of it.

So after you gather your date materials you'll want to put it together like a SpaceX rocket. The date will progress in various stages with moments available to call audibles as you see fit.

EX:

Your materials are:

Restaurants/eateries/food bases R1, R2, &amp; R3.

Your things to do are E1. E2. &amp; E3.

Places to drink are bars/clubs/lounges B1, B2, &amp; B3

Lets say you go to dinner at place (R1), because she's allergic to seafood or some shit. It goes well so you go to some live show where people paint each other nude live (E1). Now you could go for drinks at (B1) which leads to drinks at (B2) and then your dick gets blown into space.

You can mix and match whatever combination of things you want. Over time it will get easier but I stand by the benefits I mentioned above.

&amp;#x200B;

72,t3_iq7nvh,"Gave a girl my number to meet up, instead of texting me she says on tinder that she’s too busy, but gives me her number. Do I text first? Or take the business as a hint.","I was talking with a match in the app. She was moving the conversation a lot. Her responses were a paragraph sometimes and a few “LOL”s and extra letterssssss. She’s attractive for sure. After the conversation slows down over a day or two, I’m not trying to interview her to keep the chit chat going so I drop her my number last night (she’s asleep) and tell her I wanna see her after work some day since we are in similar areas. This morning I see her reply saying she works everyday and if only she had time to see me and then another message with her number.

It’s the first mixed signal I got. I thought since we were friendly over the app, I could give my number and expect a text whenever she wants, no pressure. Getting her number, instead, threw me off guard. I definitely don’t mind being first to text in a number exchange, but the “ain’t nobody got time” message preluding her number feels like she’s evading and that she’s letting me down politely. She seems like a genuinely cool person so I’m not finna crowd her if she’s on her grind. Should I just back off? 

I’m aware there’s probably 100 guys in her inbox and perhaps the way she talked with me was not unique to other guys but I’m not sure how to factor that into my thinking. She’s dope but I’m trying to draw my line early so I’m not sitting here wondering if she digs me.",Tinder,"Gave a girl my number to meet up, instead of texting me she says on tinder that she’s too busy, but gives me her number.

I've seen so many 18-19 year old single moms on this app, it's no joke. \*&lt;Insert corny single mom joke&gt; \*with 5+ inappropriate photos of yourself. Most dropped out of high school, don't have a plan for at least getting an associates degree, have no work experience, I'm just baffled. Instead of going on tinder and posting inappropriate photos of yourself, whilst flirting with random dudes on this app, why not think about the future of the new human being that you have brought into this world? And no, loving your child doesn't fucking do anything. We're talking about a whole new person that YOU have brought into this world, and YOU'RE responsible for whatever happens to him/her. 

To the irresponsible dudes that left your girl, after having sex with no protection, fuck you. So you've decided to have unprotected sex with some random girl, and you immediately leave her. What do you think will happen to the child you have brought into this world? The person that you have left, is most likely depressed and lonely, and the baby? The baby will most likely struggle growing up, since there is no second parent. The child you left will probably get bullied in school, not care about their education, etc. And to the dudes that gave into their sexual desires and sexually assaulted/raped someone, go to fucking hell. I've known so many female friends suffering from depression, PTSD, anxiety and inability to make new friends, because of shitty guys that completely ruined their lives. I'm fucking sick of these idiots just doing whatever the fuck they want, while not caring about the consequences they cause from the actions they take.

To the dogshit parents who didn't raise their children the right way, and completely neglecting them throughout their childhood, fuck you/ No it isn't your children's fault, so you can stop playing the fucking victim card.

Instead of going on tinder and posting inappropriate photos of yourself, whilst flirting with random dudes on this app, why not think about the future of the new human being that you have brought into this world? And no, loving your child doesn't fucking do anything. We're talking about a whole new person that YOU have brought into this world, and YOU'RE responsible for whatever happens to him/her. 

To the irresponsible dudes that left your girl, after having sex with no protection, fuck you. So you've decided to have unprotected sex with some random girl, and you immediately leave her. What do you think will happen to the child you have brought into this world? The person that you have left, is most likely depressed and lonely, and the baby? The baby will most likely struggle growing up, since there is no second parent. The child you left will probably get bullied in school, not care about their education, etc. And to the dudes that gave into their sexual desires and sexually assaulted/raped someone, go to fucking hell. I've known so many female friends suffering from depression, PTSD, anxiety and inability to make new friends, because of shitty guys that completely ruined their lives. I'm fucking sick of these idiots just doing whatever the fuck they want, while not caring about the consequences they cause from the actions they take.

To the dogshit parents who didn't raise their children the right way, and completely neglecting them throughout their childhood, fuck you/ No it isn't your children's fault, so you can stop playing the fucking victim card. ""I buy them the play-station, I'm the victim here"" ""I give them food, water and shelter, they don't deserve me"" ""They're depressed, I have nothing to do with it"""

Ok so backstory, my mistake I guess. I used Tinder with my **second Facebook account**, not my main one.  I sent a message that was clearly a joke and ironic saying ""I'm 12 and this is deep"". That did not slip under Tinder's radar and my account got banned that same second. I got an age restriction notice. I can't download Tinder from Apple's app store. Fair. But I don't even get the chance to prove that I'm in fact, not 12 years old. I am 21 years old and I definitely have an ID.

Fine. I read up on it. People get banned all the time. I'm not in the US so I can't use Google voice. I got a new sim card.

Just to be safe, I used my old iPhone, made a **new** Apple account under the **new phone** number and a backup e-mail address.

This might have been the mistake I made where they tracked my activity. I logged into my **main** Facebook account with the **new phone number** and it **worked**. I deleted it immediately, because I didn't want to link my Facebook account to Tinder. I was just trying it out if it works. I did this on my **PC**. Any idea on what did I exactly violate when I used my new phone number and deleted my account immediately? Is that forbidden? I didn't even have a picture nor did I swipe on anybody.

I then proceeded to create a new account on my **second phone** this time, not my PC, used my **new phone number again**, no Facebook account this time, and boom, BANNED.

So, I have no idea what to do, has anyone been in a similar situation? I sent them 2 e-mails but I'm not expecting a resolution. Should I just get a 3rd phone number and try it again?

324,t3_ip0mw1,Like Tinder but...,"Okay, I had a brilliant idea while hitting up A MILLION dudes the other night just looking for someone to get drinks or ice cream with. 

A dating app just like tinder but with a meet now function. Basically it would have a map that showed you your matches that are also interested in meeting asap. So you can see which matches are actually near you (not on the other side of the world) who are also immediately bored and looking for something to do.   

Can someone please get on this?? Thanks.

EDIT: I wasn’t talking about exactly location, just a general area, and the map would be for where you are looking to meet, not for where you actually are. So for example, say there is a new bar nearby that you want to try it would look to see if anyone else in your already existing matches is also looking to meet there. 

EDIT 2: My area is back to fully open. Social distance dating has become really common around here. It’s nice, there is less pressure to interact physically or even have a first date kiss. 10/10 would recommend trying social distance dating if your area is low risk and open for business.",Tinder,"Like Tinder but...Okay, I had a brilliant idea while hitting up A MILLION dudes the other night just looking for someone to get drinks or ice cream with.

Day 1 : 18 matches. 
Day 2: 6 matches. 
Day 3 so far : 0 matches

So yea, it's basically gold at a marked up price. The superlike messaging feature doesn't change much either, as I sent 8 of those and only Got one match from them

The priority likes seemed to be working as some of the really hot girls I was swiping I was matching with, but on day 3 it fully stopped. 

If you're already getting consistent matches and dates with tinder without any subscription, then go for it. Otherwise, it won't change much 

Truth is, I've come to realize that tinder only works if you've got that European pretty boy look and write your ""6'1"" height in your bio.

 I consider myself pretty good looking but when there's thousands of other good looking guys, there's little to no reason for them to swipe right on you unless you're in the 3% of men. Just ask yourself - if you were a girl and had an 96% chance of matching with anyone you swipe on, why swipe on 7s and 8s when there's hundreds of 9s and 10s that you're guaranteed to match with?

this is specially the truth if you're in the 18-25 year old range where all girls care about is looks and status. 

I have a few friends who get 100+ matches per week and all of them have abs and are 5""11+. Oh and don't forget the chiseled jawline. For them they love tinder and get 1-2 lays from it per week. I used to put alot of effort in bios and shit but my friends who get the craziest results literally just have their height and flag of their country. Thats when i realized there's only 1 maybe 2 factors that matter, none of that ""witty bio"" or ""swipe percentage"" and ""peak hours"" stuff.

I dont want to sound like an angry simp, but from my observations this is the truth. No subscription is going to change that. Either self improve like crazy or just approach irl",Tinder,"Tinder Platinum Review - The TruthI'm a guy (obviously) Made a new account, bought tinder platinum right away.

I dont want to sound like an angry simp, but from my observations this is the truth. No subscription is going to change that. Either self improve like crazy or just approach irl"

671,t3_inrzsn,Dating a girl who says she’s not looking for anything serious but also wants to take things slow?,"She’s from Brazil and living in Ireland about 1.5 years. I have to say I’m a tad bit confused. 

On our first date we met at a bar, had good food and she said she’s not looking for a relationship, which is fine by me. Later in the conversation on the first date she spoke about other guys running away, particularly Irish guys running away when she brings up relationship talk.

We went back to her place after the date and kissed in her bed, and got a bit handsy. I tried to escalate but she rejected further advances and said she likes taking things slow. 

On the second date she came to mine for a movie night. More kissing and hands going places, which eventually led to very hot and steamy sex. 

A few days later she messaged me saying we went a bit too far and would like to take things slower as it makes “her think about things”. 

I respond kindly and said that’s good with me etc. 

We had a third date since, but only kissing, play biting, dry humping and ass grabbing. 

There will be a 4th date which will involve cycling through the country side together 

Little bit confused. Usually, if someone is in it for casual dating, it mostly revolves around sex and physical intimacy. Dating for a relationship is more often than not a slower process of intimacy. 

I get the feeling she may be luring me in to a relationship from “the inside”, so to speak. 

She also spoke about the fact that she’s 28 y.o. and is beginning to feel left behind and feeling down as all her friends back home are getting engaged, married or having kids and the clock is ticking.

Her words don’t necessarily match her actions or align with other things she said. Regardless, I could be totally wrong. 

What’s everyone else’s general opinion? 

As for a visa, she has a French passport so she’s also technically a European citizen, so I don’t have to worry about that scenario of being used for a green card...",Tinder,"Dating a girl who says she’s not looking for anything serious but also wants to take things slow?She’s from Brazil and living in Ireland about 1.5 years.
