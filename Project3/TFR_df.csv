59,t3_ioe8w5,Is multi-dating bad?,"I’m 23F and on average I have about 3 dates a week. Many dates don’t end up progressing from the first one due to either them expecting sex (despite me bluntly saying I’m not looking for a hookup but a relationship), lying about their height, them having a shitty personality, them ghosting me, or there not being mutual interest. Therefore, I’ve never really had to worry about this.

As of recently, I met three great guys who I like. Feelings are being established and getting to know personal details. It is now on the second/third dates with them and I’m not sure at what point I should stop multi-dating or seeing the other dates. I don’t want to fuck myself over since I’m not in a committed relationship yet but that’s my goal. One has already kissed me on the second date and the others tried on the first but I typically don’t kiss on first dates but I feel like that’s going to be expected on the second/third dates and I don’t really want to be kissing everyone but also don’t want to reject them giving the impression that I lack interest. I genuinely just don’t want to kiss multiple guys every week since that’s unhygienic. 

Should I wait until I’m exclusive with one guy before stopping multi-dating or let each guy know that I’m also going on dates with other guys? I’m haven’t had sex with any of my current dates FYI. I love sex but it definitely won’t happen in such an early stage. I just feel like they will all expect more eventually since they keep asking to go on additional dates and there can really only be one guy who I end up in a relationship with if it happens.",OkCupid,"Is multi-dating bad?I’m 23F and on average I have about 3 dates a week. Many dates don’t end up progressing from the first one due to either them expecting sex (despite me bluntly saying I’m not looking for a hookup but a relationship), lying about their height, them having a shitty personality, them ghosting me, or there not being mutual interest. Therefore, I’ve never really had to worry about this.

As of recently, I met three great guys who I like. Feelings are being established and getting to know personal details. It is now on the second/third dates with them and I’m not sure at what point I should stop multi-dating or seeing the other dates. I don’t want to fuck myself over since I’m not in a committed relationship yet but that’s my goal. One has already kissed me on the second date and the others tried on the first but I typically don’t kiss on first dates but I feel like that’s going to be expected on the second/third dates and I don’t really want to be kissing everyone but also don’t want to reject them giving the impression that I lack interest. I genuinely just don’t want to kiss multiple guys every week since that’s unhygienic.

157,t3_ikusws,Commenting vs Messaging - have I been doing it wrong this whole time??,"Hey there, this is my first post. Sorry if this has been asked before recently but I couldn't find anything on it.

So I'm seeing a lot of profiles that say ""I dont swipe much and I can't see likes, so please just message me instead"". 

So for the past month, I've been commenting on pictures or interests, to try and find common ground and spark a conversation. But I haven't received any matches or responses from those comments. I don't live in a major city but still.

On top of that, I can't find any of the people I sent a comment to anywhere in my history (if I like someone without commenting, they'll show up in my ""people you liked"" tab, but they aren't visible here if I liked + commented)

After getting a little suspicious I started googling, and OKcupid's instructions on how to message someone don't mention commenting at all. Then browsing old posts someone ranted OKcupid took away direct messaging (ie showing messages before a mutual match), but that post was a few years ago. So I don't know if that still applies

Hoping you fine redditors could help set me straight: do comments not actually notify the person until after they've like me back? Or do they work like a message would? Is messaging without mutual likes still a thing or did that go away?

Also, is there anyway I can see who I sent comments to in the past? If I'm doing this wrong and no one got my messages, it'd be a bummer if I was just SOL and couldn't go back and do it the right way.

TLDR; I can't tell if my comments work like messages or not, can people see them without liking me first (assuming they're not paying for premium)? Maybe everything's working and I'm just dumb/ugly?

When Covid-19 hit, we started to question when can we end the long distance and stay somewhere together. I am determined to build my company in China, have this dream before meeting her. We kept going because she seemed to be open to this idea. However, it stressed her out too much. All her friends and family are in Poland, she doesn't want to go too far from Europe to somewhere she has no friends, family total stranger of the language, culture and lifestyles. I understand that and love her dearly but it is a life long dream that I have to give up. She won't let me give it up and decided it was time to end the relationship. She is the mature one in making this decision. ""Where"" to build our lives together was ultimately the hinder of the relationship.

I stupidly bought a month A-list on OkCupid, hoping that I will find someone ASAP but I notice I am passing on almost everyone because doesn't matter how great the women on OkCupid are, they are just not her. 

I still love her so much, with all my heart, I still love her. Countless sleepless night just reliving the most precious part of my memory. I don't dare to bother her anymore which makes me even sadder as the only way I can feel a little relieve is that if I know she is living a better, happier life.

Now it seems like any first message I send is buried under piles of crap. I used to even pay for A-list but now it is too expensive and I don't see the benefits anymore. I don't want more matches or more dates, I'm way too selective anyways and prefer to invest time in finding high quality profiles.

That being said, does anyone think they would pay money to make sure their introduction is seen by the recipient? if so, how much? How much would it cost to deter people from sending creepy or boring messages, but encourage more people to send those nice messages when they see a profile they think is perfect?"

Also none of these trap you in a direction where you have to ""be something you're not"" you can revert to other forms of communication from here. Just make your follow ups good, don't be boring, and prepared to LEAD like a MAN."

I figured this out because I get an email from OkCupid whenever I match with someone and that email has an image of their profile.

But there are plenty more people waiting in Double Take."" If they unmatched or block you it would give you a retry icon that takes you nowhere.

276,t3_ihbepy,Warning: OkCupid can delete messages and prevent you from ever talking to a match again.,"This happened to me a few times, but I figured it was a bug with unmatching/blocking/profile-deletion. Basically, I can no longer see their message in my list of messages. However, the message was open for me on the desktop site when this happened, so I could click and still see their profile. It still says we are matched, but our messages do not go through to each other.  
  
I contacted the person on instagram because this seemingly occurred so randomly, and they can still see our OkCupid message. We just can't talk to each other.

\*\*\*

As people in similar circumstances would know, the online dating game is incredibly not in the favor of males. My experience with it has been disappointing at best, and hurtful at worst. I have only ever had leads becoming prospects, and even without any ""sales"" to date, I have already experienced emotional stress numerous times from the prospects (i) ghosting, and/or (ii) dragging things on for months, only to finally express no intention in progressing past the friendzone.

Of course, some of the social factors at play here are the gender norm that males should be the pursuers (hence placing females in the passive—and hence less stressful—position), and the expectation that during the pursuit, the male should put in his best effort while having to steel himself for whatever disappointment that potentially lurks at the end (of the attempt).

Having experienced this stress multiple times by now, I can say that whenever it happens, my mood will become greatly dampened—and even doing the things I like may not be enough of a distraction to dull the pain.

I am not going to make myself a case study here, and solicit custom advice on what went wrong with my earlier attempts. Instead, I would like to know this: What are your strategies for coping with this type of stress?

(P.S. Serious answers only, please.)

\*\*\*

EDIT: To clarify, online dating does not currently consume my life. Some comments below seem to have that assumption. I am just someone who uses online dating every now and then, and I cannot help but be emotionally invested in a prospect when I do get one. And in my experience, the disappointment that usually awaits at the end of the process is unavoidable.

As many of you, I have been signed up in OKC since when it served for something. I don't remember when this guy started to appear among my suggestions, but I know it was a long time ago.

Last week, due to all changes in OKC, I decided to use the web instead of the app for the first time in years.

I read his profile and questions comments, and we had a mindset similar (scientific, atheist, leftish, childfree...) and a lot in common (native language, reading as the favorite hobby, outdoors addicts...). We are on different continents.

I ’liked’ him, obviously... he had ’liked’ me first 🎉. I sent him a comment about one of our childhood’s favorite writers. And shit happened... After almost two days without reaction to my message and seeing the guy online several times by day, I started to think that maybe the message wasn't received (first time I use OKC after the ”remodeling”)... you know, this guy has ’liked’ me, I thought serious persons on OKC ’like’ someone for some reason. 

I sent a second message explaining that I saw him online and I was not sure if my first message was received. He responded one hour later, confirming that no one message was lost, **he had not responded because he would need to seat with calm to write a response in line with my message and he had this in his TODO list.** I replied I would wait for ”the message” patiently.

Anyway, when I tried to log in through Facebook, the window pops up asking for me to allow OKCupid access to Facebook.  After clicking ""allow"" it gave me a few error messages, including ""wrong OKCupid username and password"" (?).  I tried Safari instead of Chrome, and this time the login was successful.  However, it routed me to the onboarding path as if I was creating an account for the first time.

2. Will I be able to see intros from people outside of my parameters?  Since Search has been removed, it's harder to actually find people now, so I wouldn't mind being able to receive messages from people I otherwise wouldn't see.
3. Will I always receive notifications by email or on the site/app itself, alerting me that I have a new intro message?  Will it notify me even if the Intro is from someone outside my parameters?
4. If I pass on an intro, but change my mind later and reset all of my passes, will their intro return to my Intros tab?  Will I ever be able to find this person again and message them?
5. Similarly, if I unmatch someone, but decide to give things another shot, is it possible to restore the lost intro message or conversation?
6. Once I like someone and start a conversation with them, will I be able to visit their profile again to review their match questions?
7. I like to take time writing a good first message, so sometimes I'll like a profile and then come back to it the next day to actually send the message.  Is it still possible to do this, or do profiles vanish as soon as I like them?

417,t3_idel2l,Is there a dating platform where travelers are welcome?,"I am a traveler. I’ve tried hard to learn to not travel, but I just can’t do it. I lose my mind if I stay in one place past about two weeks. I have a home, I just can’t bring myself to stay there more than a couple weeks at a time. I seem to only be happy on the road. In all my travels I’ve been vaguely looking for a new place to settle down in hopes that maybe the right place would cure my wanderlust, but despite all the amazing places I’ve been I’ve never encountered somewhere I believed I could stay indefinitely. Stationary life just isn’t for me. 

This has been, shall we say, problematic for my dating life, my whole life. While I was able to justify my travel with a uniform during my brief military phase, it was less of an issue, perhaps even an asset as women seemed drawn to me just based on my job; but when I ended that job, suddenly nobody wanted anything to do with me once they learned of my travel habits. I don’t think I travel a lot, but apparently to most people anything more than one or two trips covering at most a week or two is too much. I cover usually around 100,000 miles a year and sleep outside of the house at least 100 nights a year, probably closer to 150 in a typical year. I even tried using covid as an exercise in traveling less, but I couldn’t sustain it; after the first month I still couldn’t do it, and just learned to be more self-contained in my travels; I’ve been on the road three weeks straight now and have been social distancing even more than at home, but I still can’t stay still. 

Anyway, while on this trip I decided to give online dating a try, on the hypothesis that maybe I’m just not suited to the women of my “home” area. (I usually try to focus my dating on the place I spend most of my time, but I was wondering if hating travel was just a Buffalo thing). Well, it seems that in the PNW I get slightly more matches in the first place, but even more unmatches, and it took about ten messages for the one person who actually chatted to reveal she resented my lifestyle (“some of us have to work” and “lol” when I pointed out that I work every day and make good money). So I’m guessing that maybe this means the hatred of travel and resentment of nomads is universal, even in the covid era when working remotely is starting to lose some of its stigma. 

I’ve been told a lot on this subreddit that my travel habit is going to be considered a dealbreaker to most. I’m just wondering... is that truly and completely universal?

I know there exist women who do not hate this lifestyle. I encounter them periodically, but either the timing is wrong (one girl asked me on a date last year over Facebook, but we couldn’t coordinate to be in the same state long enough to meet up; I randomly ran into her in Washington last week but now she’s seeing someone) or the mutual attraction is missing (accidentally broke a travel nurse’s heart last year... well, actually two travel nurses). 

I would imagine the women who share this lifestyle have a similar problem, though probably not as badly; there seems to be a surplus of male nomads, so perhaps the women just don’t need assistance selecting from us. But I’d think if there’s room for niche platforms for every imaginable orientation, kink, religion, and even Farmers Only, there ought to be *something* for travelers.

430,t3_ict86z,Question from a non-user about OKC emails,"I haven't used OKC since around 2013 so I have no idea how it works anymore, and I'm trying to find out what types of emails owners of deleted or inactive profiles might receive. I promise I searched before posting this but couldn't really find any definitive info, and my almost 3-year relationship is hinging on this so I really hope you guys can help.

This past January my boyfriend was showing me something on his computer and I saw he had an email from OKC. At the time I figured it was just spam cause it wasn't about matches or messages, it was just something like ""Don't miss happy hour, lots of people are online tonight!"". My own spam folder is filled with hot singles and messages from sites I've never even been to so I wasn't too worried at the time. I knew he had used OKC in the past, but he last used it over 3 years ago before we even started dating and says it went inactive.

We broke up for a couple weeks in early April of this year (this is relevant, I swear) and during a conversation we had a few weeks ago about the importance of honesty he told me he reactivated it briefly after the breakup. I had left him for lying and hitting on his ex, but he swears he's a changed man with nothing to hide anymore... 🤡 Anyway he offered to delete his profile while I watched as sort of a trust-building exercise. We haven't gotten around to doing that yet, but the more I think about it the more I'm starting to think he's been using OKC the whole time we've been together. I can't find anything online that says exactly what kind of emails inactive users might get, but I would imagine they'd read more like ""we miss you, come back!"", not emails inviting people who haven't logged in for years to whatever happy hour is. That email also went to his main inbox and not the junk folder, and he's *very* particular about inbox organization. He has everything unimportant routed to either the junk folder or secondary folders. Lastly, OKC's own site says they delete inactive profiles after 2 years of no activity, so if he really hadn't used it at all since around mid/late 2017 like he claims, he wouldn't have even been *able* to reactivate it in April. That would have been at least 6 months past the 2 year cutoff, so at best he was still active on there up until 4-5 months into our relationship. 

I know I could just ask him about this but since I've caught him in multiple lies in the past I highly doubt he'd admit to it, especially since he knows I'd dump him on the spot if he did. I thought about catfishing him but I just can't bring myself to do it. Maybe I'm not strong enough to handle it if he actually messages back, I dunno. I'm thinking about telling him that I'm ready to finally sit down together and delete his profile this weekend and just demand to see his chats right after he logs in, but I'm assuming he's cleaned up his inbox if he's even willing to let me be present when he logs in. It feels like a trick honestly. I want to be at least fairly certain that the email &amp; the 'circumstantial evidence' are really as damning as they seem before I make any decisions about the relationship. 

I'm sure this is probably better posted in the relationship subs, but I wanted to get opinions from actual OKC users who know how the site works. I have a really bad feeling about this but what do you guys think?

It feels like a trick honestly. I want to be at least fairly certain that the email &amp; the 'circumstantial evidence' are really as damning as they seem before I make any decisions about the relationship. 

I'm sure this is probably better posted in the relationship subs, but I wanted to get opinions from actual OKC users who know how the site works. I have a really bad feeling about this but what do you guys think? Thank you in advance, and sorry this is so long."

447,t3_ibb4u3,Sudden repulsion syndrome?,"18F here. I met this great guy around a month ago, and he's nearly perfect–cute, intelligent, same cultures, same views, supportive, understanding, patient, and caring. We were extremely compatible and were comfortable talking hours and hours without any awkward moments. It didn't take long before we confirmed that we were exclusive.

However, yesterday, I suddenly felt repulsed when I saw his texts. Something in my just went 'ick' and I felt like I needed to puke. Everything was going great until then. I tried to press it down, tell myself that I'm being delusional, but the 'ick' just didn't go away. Instead, it grew stronger and stronger. It's now 2:30 am and I'm so stressed about what to do. I haven't felt such strong anxiety like this since high school, during which my social anxiety was at its strongest. 

I tried searching the internet for what this weird 'ick' is and apparently it's called Sudden Repulsion Syndrome, which happens a short period after you start dating. According to what I've heard on reddit, it has something to do with your subconscious picking up on things that you can't consciously notice because you're viewing things from rose-tinted glasses. Now that I look back on it, there are red flags that would somewhat send me running. For example, his unusual eagerness to advance the relationship. He would text things like ""I want to keep you in my house for a week"" and ""I am never letting you go""–mind you, this is after the second or third date. Oh, and he's already trying to buy me a birthday gift for my birthday that's months away.

Another thing that I've noticed is how he tends to put me on a pedestal. When I was a teenager, I've heard how people hate being put onto a pedestal because it makes them feel less human and makes the relationship feel less genuine. I didn't understand it then, but now I do. He would adamantly refuse to let me pay for anything, would insist on walking me home despite my refusals (my house is 1 hour away from his), and would always 'adhere' to my wishes, like saying ""yes madam"" and ""anything you want."" I mean, at first I was flattered but then I noticed how weird it was to be in a relationship with a man who kind of worships you??? I guess my question is, is this a legitimate thing or am I just being too paranoid? Should I end the relationship?

TLDR; I suddenly felt repulsed by a guy I've been dating for a month, and now I can see the red flags I've been missing. Am I just paranoid or is my concern legit?

What can I do better?,"As the title says, I've never had personal experience with online dating apps before, though I've heard much about them on Reddit and elsewhere. I'm trying to manage my expectations since I'm aware the majority of women you swipe won't match with you, fewer of those will message, fewer of those will agree to a date and so on.

I also thought though that most dating apps ""elevate"" your profile to the top of people's stacks in the days after you sign up to simulate the idea that a lot of people are interested in you. If that's true, then how would you judge my first week's results?

OkCupid:

- 12 Likes received. No matches. 
- Sent maybe 15-20+ intro messages to women. No responses. I tried to make all intro messages a question/comment about something they had in their profiles.

Bumble:

- 3 matches. All expired with no message.
- Unknown number of likes. Bumble is offering a free trial of Boost to let me see who they are.

I'm a very introverted homebody of a person so I'm thinking about what else I can do or photos to take to make my profiles pop out more.

485,t3_iatblv,From love to friendship to family and everything inbetween - Got a minute? Could use some honest opinions,"So here’s the story (shortest version ap). 
He and I met in highschool, 2 weeks in and he told me it was love at first sight. Not for me. Grew out to be very good friends within 3 years. Called each other bro/sis, family level. Graduated, doubted if I should give dating him finally a shot (since there was a vibe and signals) but didn’t want to ruin the friendship so closed that chapter firmly. 

Couple months later found out he liked me (again/still) and instead of seeing it as an opportunity I somehow felt offended and betrayed bc I thought it was all bro/sis but in retrospect felt like his intentions must’ve been different (saying ily, suggestive language and stuff). He did not admit, I was very cold to him, thought I should give him space bc I still wanted to salvage the friendship so we only talked occasionally. During the following 5 months things were looking up and slowly getting back to how they were but then out of nowhere he got a girlfriend and very intense so. 

Still kept in touch and hung out occasionally (apologized couple of times for letting him down when he was vulnerable bc I realized I should’ve handled it differently and he accepted the apologies). Helped him move and tried to be there for big moments but drama almost everytime we hung out bc his gf always seemed to have some kind of ‘issue’ that exact moment so he had to call her and calm her down and stuff (jealousy bc I was with him?) He then started to change dramatically from the person I knew for 4,5 years. Different style of speaking and behaving, going into advices he once gave me himself, got into an intense religion (she introduced him, he was non religious) and here we are 2,5 years later. 

Ofcourse I am jealous our friendship went haywire (since he started dating her) and blamed myself for that big time (it was not ‘just a friendship’ but a very special bond, both went through very difficult stuff and helped each other get through it). But I can’t get over the fact and gut feeling something’s not right. He seems almost under her spell, on pics he looks dazy and pale, lost most of his strong physique, has a different facial expression and is practically married to her on every level. 

Maybe selfish but feels like she was his escape from his feelings he had towards me for probably 4,5 years. To make matters worse I recently looked back on my life and realized he was/is my first true love but had no space/wasn’t ready for that then, bc I was struggling with myself and life a lot. So here I am, just now experiencing heartbreak and everything that comes with it. (Dramatic thoughts, never gonna get over this and stuff, you guys know what I’m talking about)

Bumble has been similar.  Couldn't get anyone to actually commit to a date -  a few sort of vaguely say they want to meet up, don't make any clear plans, and then last minute are all casually 'oh hey, did ya still wanna meet'.  So just a-holes trying to keep an option open if nothing better comes along.

I used to be good at this.  Maybe its because i now clearly say i don't want hookups.  Or I guess more likely I'm old and fat!

But I find I am not attracted to bigger women and more attracted to thinner or normal weight girls myself.

A man will find a slim average woman attractive, as men value slimness highly, but a large number of women will not find a slim average man attractive.    Things like height and facial masculinity are more important to women.  

Maybe because my face isn't ""hot"" and I'm below 6ft0 with a slightly receeding hairline,  for some reason that makes me more obtainable in these obese women's eyes.

I am sure you all get this frequently, but I wanted to just vent I suppose. I'm back on the website for the first time in 5 years and it seems OkCupid has taken some incredibly obnoxious design decisions.

1: Limited amount of likes.

2: Can only ""send and intro"" to someone you've liked.

3: If you're out of likes and someone sends you an intro, you can not respond until you get likes back.

I get that the company needs to make money, so I check to see the cost for subscribing and it's $45 for a single month. 

I am also using Hinge, Bumble, and Coffee Meets Bagel, which all use similar methods for monetization, but something about this feels the worst of them all.

What is an expected ""rate of interaction"" between people that can be considered reasonable? I know everyone is busy and I never expect anyone to be available all the time, nor do I expect real time chats when they're busy or that they don't want to. I have no problem with any of that.

But I find it very frustrating when people simply don't reply to things for days, especially time-sensitive things like setting up a date/call/whatever.

Now, the obvious take on this is ""they're not that into you so just move on"", but the actual content of the interaction doesn't indicate that - the communications are long (enough) and friendly, seemingly interested. I know it seems like many men can't tell the difference between putting up with someone and actually seeming interested, but I'm pretty aware of the difference, and yes I know my saying that probably makes it look like I don't. But anyway, let's leave that judgement out of this:

Should I assume that anyone who doesn't really reply within a day or two to be not really interested, even if we were on a date and they seem like they really enjoyed it? If they've said ""we should do something again"", but do not respond to the planning of the next date in days, sometimes weeks? If they've said ""I really enjoy spending time with you"" but when you try to initiate a date, they kinda just dodge around it?

Am I having trouble reading mixed signals, or are these not mixed signals - am I just used to a faster pace of intimacy than ""most"" people? Is most of the world/women running on a different rhythm than I am? Or am I not reading the correct signals?

I am aware that women get inundated with matches and fending men off. I don't ask for an hour a day or something. A week without reply seems like they don't care. I also don't flood them, if they don't reply to a message, that's fine, I just leave it.

607,t3_i6sgyz,Let's have a classic chat: What even is the point if you're average / below average?,"Figured I'd come see what the deal is and directly ask.

**So about me**. 26, 5'7"", ""A Little Extra"" to ""Curvy"" build and actively trying to change that (To be precised - 13 and a half stone to 14 stone currently with a fat gut because lads get it there first), long brown hair, blueish eyes, learning to drive but have a car, soon to be Mature Student (for anyone not UK, basically just means you're older than normal students), living alone in a decent student flat when I start located right in the city, listed interests, answers etc etc

***If you want to know more, just ask.***

**My interests:** Women, Age range 18 - 29, Distance ideally is 10 miles due to not fully having a license but opened to 25 miles to allow any possibilities of travelling in the future, Body type at thin - fit - average - a little extra - curvy - full figured, height 4'0"" to 5'9"", the rest is pretty much open.

Now before I say my ideal connections, yes I'm aware I'm possibly limiting myself but I'm not ready nor would it be fair on someone to commit to a relationship the way my life is right now. 

In short, suicidal mental breakdown lasting a few years in the past. That's behind me, I'm recovering within the last year and trying to piece back the life I want. Understandable? 

So I've literally been trying for friends, hook ups, something casual yadda yadda and I state that. Even say if there is no desire to pursue anything sexual immediately or down the line it would still be great and perfectly fine to just chat, maybe make a friend near by. 

Trying to remain as honest as I can in a mature way, in a bid to be open about things. I see it as, surely you'd want to be the most comfortable around who ever you meet, so being genuine would help make that possible. Then hopefully you and the person you meet know exactly what you want to fully enjoy your time together.

Now the thing is I've been trying about 7 sites with one currently on premium (originally 9 but by god 2 of them were just a joke), all for just over a month, maybe month and a half. With the same attitude of remaining honest about what I'm looking for and taken particular note of anybody with the same interests (because a common ground is always helpful right?).

For OKC, well. **I've no recollection of a single woman being within my city, not one.** If I was to give you rough figures: 80% London, 15% too far away in a city / village I've never heard of, 5% fake location. 

In terms of likes or anything, literally 1 lady in London that I have actually spoken to a ***little*** bit but currently no response and they've been online (I'm aware of other factors like they have their own life to attend to and that's fine but really that can only be applied for so long, we'll just have to wait and see). Any more? Nope. Messages sent? Yup. 

Not only that, but it seems as though my filters mean nothing to OKC with a prime example being distance.

So honestly, all of this **including the other sites or apps** thus far. Really give the impression that if you're not above a certain grade shall we say. You've got no chance, that notion is currently feeling more and more like this is all a waste of time (MONEY in one case!), that is questioning if it can be more depressing than the depression I had.

I might post this to the other apps / sites relative areas or I might not. Just depends how I feel as I currently sit here with a rant and plea at night.

An idea of how the other sites / apps have been so far:

App A (Premium) = 3 Matches no response, 1 started by them.

App B = 1 Like, short chat. User Deleted.

App C = 0.

App D = 0.

or simply commitment before sex, or no hookups before commitment.  


\*LDR= Long Distance Relationship.  


I am having a complex feeling so I am writing this post to vent my emotions.  


My Brazilian ex-boyfriend quit his job to come to Australia from 17000km(10563.31 miles) away and we are actually not compatible, after about 3 years, we can't make it together, I broke up with him peacefully.  


In 2017, I decided to study in Australia and that's also for Permanent Residency(Green Card), I am an old-school kind of guy who never hook up and will not meanwhile having a strong sexual desire. I find it extremely hard for me to date anyone, first is because I live in a small city, secondly I find white guys in Australia is not really into asian guys, especially when they are not feminine, unfortunately I am just a normal asian guy that acts 'straight', actually nobody knows that I am gay, I keep this to myself because it's better I come out proudly with my partner, it's such a beautiful thing to me.  


BTW I have a thing for white guys, especially those with blue/green eyes.  


So I started by looking at several online apps, for Grindr, I was there about for 3 months and finally a kind guy told me that this app is for fun only, I deleted it then tried Tinder, doesn't work. Finally I used OKCupid.  


I locked in some restrictions: Demisexual, Gay, White or Hispanic and answer dozens of questions and finally find a match - my ex.(he's half Italian and half Spanish, he isn't blonde at all).  


After a few days I fell in love with him, he was travelling alone in Chile climbing mountains, on his way back to Brazilian in a Starbucks, I managed to contact a local Chinese guy(spent some money, of course) to help me delivery Roses to him and I said I love him. then after a few months he accepts me...  


We talked every day, sharing everything, if we don't have anything to talk to, we say good morning and good night and share some random pictures, the most amazing thing is that he always reply my message in 5 minutes maximum, normally 1-2 minutes.  


On 2019, he decided to quit his job and came to Australia, he was stressed too, he doesn't have much money (he was 28 and had a deposit of Australian $7000) and Australia or Canada is somewhere he wants to settle. I applied for my Permanent Residency and I was granted that at October 2019. I will help him with that if we get along and I really hoped so.  


He applied for Travel Visa first and after he arrives I paid a few hundred $ money to an agency for him to get a student visa and scholarship.  


I am an extremely caring person to all my friends and family without asking anything back:  
I paid all the money when he stays here from November 2019 till July 2020. I buy most of the the groceries, I buy him SIM card plans, I pay for all the bills at the rental house and 100% of the rent, I bought new fridges, new bed and everything, all he had to pay was his tuition fee and the meal he had outside himself. I am okay with paying but I currently don't have a job and I will run out of money too. For the 9 months, he only applied for ONE JOB in July when I told him I need to break up with him.  


Things depress me a lot and I cannot PERCEIVE love or care from him for the most of the time, I can give some examples:  
I told him about everything of me, he knows that I am doing ketogenic diet and it's important to me, he doesn't give a damn about knowing it, let alone cook anything for me, I told him if I ever feel depressed(rarely but yeah), can he make just make a fried egg for me? he said no, ' I am not your mom', ' we have to cook together', it really hurts but I accepted it, people maybe are just different.  


I left Australia in Jan and be back in June, from Nov 2019- Jan 2020, I feel really confused about what love is, is this really what I am looking for? before I leave I asked him to take care of my car by starting it every week. he didn't do it after doing it for 3 weeks. seems like his partner's most valuable item left in Australia is not important at all to him, he didn't even bother to tell me about it.  


I developed an acute gout when I come back at June, I really need to drink a lot of water like at least 10L every day but I just cannot move at all from my bed, the foot is swollen and painful. I asked him if he could pass me some water, he says I have to wait for 10 minutes because he's playing a phone game. it is not only for once, it's every time, I feel so desperate because I really need that water right now and I have to ask for help for 20 times a day at least, but just for passing water, took less than 5 seconds. As a result I have to take double the painkiller and did it all by myself, every time I left my bed, I have to re-apply medicine to my foot again.  


During the time I had gout attack, I asked him to buy me food from a nearby restaurant, he asks money EVERY TIME BEFORE HE GOES THERE, it's just $20.. OMG...I paid at least $12,000 for just rent and..this is what I get returned. That's when I really want to put everything to an end, I have told him so and he agreed.  


We only had 3 times of sex: I topped him twice, he had a failed try on me because he is too big and thick for me (20cm, super thick), I am really kinky when it comes to sex but he doesn't wanna do any kinky things and he doesn't seem very interested in sex too, so I didn't even bother to ask him for sex anymore.////  


Here is my question:  
where can I find and date old-school guys?  
I downloaded OKCupid again but this app isn't the same anymore, I tried every city in Australia and New Zealand, there is no match for me, I sent a few hundred Intros but got 0 reply,  


When I switch to the USA, I got many likes but still gets no reply, I guess people just don't trust LDR..

656,t3_i4x2eb,(Completely) New to this and Nervous!,"Hi everyone,

So, lockdown got me thinking...

I am a lady of a certain age. I live with my cat whom I adore with all of my heart.

Being single hasn't really bothered me for years. Some times I feel awkward that I never have a plus one for social occasions. I know now that baby route is extremely unlikely... And that is ok! I am extremely anxious (take medication for anxiety) and have myriad self-esteem issues. Nothing can hurt me, right.

Anyway... Here goes... I am lonely! (Gosh, I am nearly crying.) I long for some kind of intimacy - from the romance novel stuff (I devoured Mills &amp; Boon books back in the day, sigh) to just sitting under a blanket together sharing snacks and drinking hot chocolate in front of the TV.

I am telling myself not to be so scared any more as life is too short. A cousin of mine (who has just been through an egregious breakup) has told me about Tinder. Well, now this sounds scary... I am not sure how I would cope with it.

I have signed up to OK Cupid. I have answered some of the questions and have completed my profile (leaving off photo because I don't like looking at myself) (I know). I have stipulated ""friendship"" and ""long-term relationships"".

I don't really know what I am doing and whether I should be doing this! Lockdown has made me do some out of character things (well, I did finish reading ""War and Peace"" after an eternity 😉). I want to embrace life and I would love to find Mr. Right but I am scared... (And my cat would have to like him. Very important!)

Worried about what you just said or how it will be received? Let it go.

Feel like you ruined your life? Let that go.

Hate the pandemic? Let it go.

Hate others telling you what you should be? Let it go.

Feel like you need to live up to the expectations of others? Just let it go.

Feel like you aren't being all you can be? Let that go too.

Worried about the future? Regret that past? Let that go.

Make it a game you play with yourself. Be aware of how you make yourself feel, or how circumstances make you feel. See if you can let these things go. For even just 5 minutes. This can work for nurosis, obsessions, compulsive disorders, egocentric problems, and much more.

Just chip away at it. Work it like a muscle.

See your life change in small ways and big ones.

Don't beat yourself up when you can't let it go. Just try and be aware, and work on it one thing at a time."

667,t3_i4p12o,"Banned, what the heck?","Hi guys, I use OkCupid since two years or so. Everything's been great so far, went on a few dates over the years. (I was just a bit disappointed that Okc tends to match me with people from the other side of the world - Indonesia, Philippines - although I set the maximum distance to 30 km or so).


Yesterday the app didn't work during the whole day. ""It's not you, it's us"" on the home screen. Today I had a notification that told me ""our terms and services have been updated"". So I thought ""oh sweet, the bug is gone, let's use the app"".


It landed me on the login page and when  I put my email address, I got an error message: ""your account has been banned. Please review our terms of services and community guidelines for more information"".


I gave a look at them but I don't know at all what happened. I think I've never said or done anything wrong with the app. The only thing that comes to mind is that I answered ""no"" to the question ""are you a feminist?"" and ""not at all"" to ""how important is astrology for you?"" (please don't judge). IMO that is the only thing they could ban me over, but it's quite far-fetched.


Either that, or someone who doesn't like me has reported me for no reason (I have exes nearby) and the app banned me without examining my profile. This comes to my mind because tinder did exactly that (one report from an ex, permanently banned). Tbh, it would sadden me if Okc was not better than tinder on the moderation side.



Does anyone have a clue as to why I was banned, or how I can get more information?

Results indicated that willingness to date intra-racially was generally high and that willingness to date inter-racially was lower and influenced by racial social status.

So while she may well enjoy the conversations we have, it's unlikely that she sees it as this big deal that I do.

Am I right in how I'm thinking about this? And if so what to do about it going forward?"

For the second date we've decided to have a night in to cook something together and probably watch a movie. We talked so much about pretty much everything in the first date that I know her favourite food and movie genre, I even know her favourite tree. As I know those things, I thought why not? Let's just cook that (as it's one of my favourite dishes too) and why wouldn't we watch a movie in the genre? I even thought about bringing her a small branch of her favourite tree and explaining that ""it's a bit early into this for flowers so here you get your favourite tree instead"" as an icebreaker when I pick her up.

So what I'm divided about here is whether she'll take it bad and find it creepy and a bit ""try-hard"" for doing so. Or just really appreciate the fact that I listened and remembered what she likes and what she's allergic to and so on. 

What do we think?

727,t3_i2yhou,Unsure about how I feel and really struggling with it,"Hi everyone,

26M here and been dating someone (24F) for two months now and I’ve never been more conflicted when dating someone and we are at a crossroads now. 

She’s sweet, kind, gentle, and I love talking to her and spending time with her. She’s a beautiful soul who has been through a lot of things in the past year or so. But I think I worry sometimes I’m not feeling that spark. I don’t find myself being very intimate emotionally or physically or super excited to hang out. When we do Skype calls, I like spending time with her, but I’m also not eagerly awaiting it or overly excited, if that makes sense. I’ve had hard a time determining what it is exactly, but she’s definitely more of a reserved, quiet, and bookie personality and I’m more extroverted, like sports, am very political and outspoken, etc. There’s nothing inherently good or bad with either and I know people can date those with opposite interests and personalities, but I do think we are quite different people and that might be part of it. I usually prefer romantic partners who bring out the more extroverted side of myself and are very flirty, outgoing, etc. 

Anyway, she sensed something was off and brought it up when we were hanging out and I had to be honest about my lack of clarity and generally being unsure of how I feel. That I did feel like our personalities were different and that something was amiss that I couldn’t quite place. It was essentially a breakup but then the next day I woke up and it just didn’t sit right with me and so we talked some more and had a very good, adult conversation and are on good terms and decided we are going to take some time to collect our thoughts and see how we feel and go from there. 

As some background, I struggled with insecurity issues for a long time and so for much of my dating life, I was always into people not into me and was never into people who were into me. I’ve come a long way and am confident for the first time in my life, but I worry that lingering insecurity is somehow still there subconsciously. Deep insecurities burrow down deeply and impact you in so many ways. I’ve now dated 3-4 people in a row who I’ve felt this way about. That something was just off and that I didn’t feel the spark or intimacy. And I really can’t tell if that’s because I have simply not found the right person yet, or if my past insecurities are catching up to me and I *could* have feelings for these people but I’m just not letting myself. Or if I’m overthinking all of this. 

I go to bed some nights and think “okay you don’t feel that spark or intimacy, that’s a sign that something is off and it’s best you end things” but then it’ll be literally the next day where it saddens me to lose her. I worry about hurting her and making her sad, I worry about losing someone I genuinely really enjoy having in my life, and I worry about the possibility of regretting it all down the road. 

So I’m at an impasse and have been for some time now. I’m deeply torn between trusting my instincts that something is off in how I feel, and questioning my instincts and not wanting to lose someone I really like. But it hurts me regardless. This person has done nothing wrong and is an amazing person and I want them in my life. In some ways it would be reassuring if they had done something wrong because then at least I’d have some valid reason to not feel 100%. Maybe my indecision itself is an answer, but one I’m avoiding because it would break my heart and hers. Dating is tough and hard and it sucks the expectations of meeting someone through dating apps means you either often end up lovers or strangers again.

746,t3_i2c880,When should you tell someone that you're a divorcee?,"Hi guys,


This is probably going to sound incredibly un-worldly of me, or might just be regarded as a daft question outright, but please do hear me out.


I'm a UK native, but I lived in Russia for six years. During that time I got married to a girl because we both wanted to open an English school. We kind of got swamped up in that euphoria of working toward a mutual goal and things were good for a while but, in the end, it didn't work out and we realised we didn't have much else left. We were totally different characters that, pragmatically speaking, complemented one another when it came to running a business but we didn't really share common values.


Anyway, I'm not going to pretend for a moment that all that wasn't a mistake or that I wasn't exceedingly immature for getting married under those circumstances, but the past is the past. We were married for two years, didn't have any mutual property nor did we have kids. We separated amicably and no longer communicate.


Now during my remaining time in Russia, I dated. When it came to online dating (mostly through Tinder), I would get talking to a girl and then, round about the point we were ready to swap numbers I'd say something to the effect of ""Hey, I'm sorry if this is a little forward but, just in case it's a dealbreaker for you, I wanted you to know that I got divorced last summer. Might be a bit odd to mention it but I feel happier knowing all the cards are on the table.""


Nobody ever took issue with it. I can't say to what extent it was cultural differences (divorce being rather easy out in Russia and exceedingly common) or just because, as a Westerner, I was quite desirable there.



It's not proven the case on OkCupid. Three times now I've had nice conversations going, I've reached that point that we've both mentioned meeting up and then I drop something similar about being divorced and, each time, I just got ghosted.



I don't mean to whine with this post, nor am I disputing that people have the right to be discerning of anything about a match and that their tastes/values are entirely subjective and their own business. My motive in making this thread is to simply ask just what the best way is to approach my divorce with western women? As, obviously, it's not something I'm really experienced with.



My sister told me I should wait until I'm actually on a date with them, but that feels manipulative to me. In honesty this is proving a bit of a hangup for me and I'm not sure how to deal with it. I want to honestly present information to people before they feel like they're wasting their time with me, in the event that my being a divorcee is a dealbreaker. When should I break the news and how should I present it?


As I said, we were married for two years. We didn't own any property together nor did we have kids. Really it's no different from any other relationship. Divorce in Russia is easy peasy and we have no existing connections nor are we really in contact.


At the same time, though, I recognise that it was a legal union and that, perhaps, it might make me ""tainted goods,"" so to speak.



So, yeah, I'd be grateful for any advice please :)

796,t3_i0m4re,Should I fall back or ? Advice welcomed!,"So about a month ago, I met this really cute guy on OkCupid. Im 24 and he is 41, but it’s not really a big deal because I have always dated men that are significantly older. We clicked immediately over our love for music, history, and our disapproval of the two party system😂. We have seen each other about 7 or 8 times, with 3 of those times being us chilling at his house. 

Now here is my conundrum ...

•He has a teenage daughter who he sees every 
Tuesday, Thursday , and every other weekend. 

•He plays soccer on Wednesday’s and Thursday’s

•He is an eighth grade math teacher and I’m a PhD student who teaches a couple of classes on the side. Obviously my schedule is a bit more lax than his.  

I also think it’s important to note that because of his busy life I let him initiate nearly 95% of our convos, so I think it’s fair to say he is somewhat interested. And I like him a lot. He totally gives me butterflies and I want to see where this can go but need to spend TIME together to figure stuff out ... 

For example on a week that he has his daughter for the weekend, we could potentially go 9 days without seeing each other.....i  just don’t have time for that. 

I know I don’t have any claim to his time this early, but I’m apprehensive as to what this would mean for us in short-term and long-term. I enjoy spending quality time with someone even if it just means watching Netflix  or cooking together. I know this early on it can seem clingy or even crazy, but I’d like to know if he can fit me in to his life. I just feel like maybe I should fall back.

799,t3_i04o1u,What's the deal with agreeing to a date then ghosting or cancelling the day before?,"This has happened with the last... oh, three women I've talked to? Near the beginning of this year, I was talking to a woman, we seemed to be getting on well, via OkC messages. I asked her out, she agreed, and we scheduled a time and place. The day we were supposed to meet, her account was gone, and I foolishly hadn't gotten her number. The next day, her account reappeared, and I asked her what happened; she said she was uncomfortable dating someone younger than her, which kind of seems like BS to me as she was 32 and I'm 28, which to my mind hardly seems like a significant age difference. But whatever.

A month or so later, I was talking with someone else. We did meet for coffee (before COVID), and had some great conversation, and she texted me first later that evening. I asked her out for a second date, and she agreed. The day before we were supposed to meet, she wouldn't respond to my confirmation message. The next morning, she said something along the lines of ""I'm actually not ready for a relationship, joining OkCupid was premature."" Whatever that means.

This month, talking to someone else. We'd had two video chat dates, which I thought both went very well. At the end of the first one, she suggested we talk again. At the end of the second one, she acted surprised when she'd seen we'd been talking for two hours, and said she had thought we'd only been talking 45 minutes! She agreed to an in-person (outdoor, socially distant) date. Two days before the date, I messaged to confirm, and she said she might not be able to do the day we scheduled, but would ""definitely let me know tomorrow."" Never heard back. Then the day we were supposed to meet, she blocked me. Absolutely no explanation at all.

Is this normal? I've been on OkCupid for a few years, and haven't had much luck, but in the past women have generally just said ""sorry, I'm not really feeling it"" or something after the first date, or just ghosted before talking about a second. Fair enough, I get it. But this whole agreeing to a date and then cancelling or just totally ghosting the day before is driving me nuts!

""Questions"" removes most the stuff that was in ""Discovery"".  Some of that stuff was useless like ""they're also non-smokers"" which was fine when combined with other criteria, but bad by itself.

My Self-Summary

I enjoy learning how to do things and then doing them. I like the woods more than the city. Split on the beach vs. the mountains with the ideal being a rocky mountainous coast where the forest meets the ocean. Coffee is best served hot. Autumn is my season. Put whatever you want on your pizza. Please vote this year.I am in an open marriage with a woman I love and am committed to. Questions?

I'm Really Good At

I enjoy problem solving. I fix it, change it, make it better, refine it, or fail completely. I enjoy attempting to play a host of instruments in order to capture their sounds. My latest acquisition is a pan flute so my goat legs should be coming in any day now. I make the best cheesy grits this side of the Rockies. I recognize beauty in its varied shapes, forms, colors, sizes, and temperaments. Finding beautiful little bits and pieces and helping them get to their next destination is a hobby of mine. Holding hot things for slightly longer periods than humanly normal is one of my awesome powers as is always having lip balm.

 Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food 

If it shows talent and creativity I will give it a look, listen, whirl or evenly possibly even a go. I don't like pop. Fourtet, Agnes Cobel, Fingathing, French Kiwi Juice, and Ensemble Galilei are holding my attention atm. I am picking up more and more books on foraging in the PNW. Movies I like run the gamut from good sci-fi to documentaries. I am open to a wide variety of foods. If it won't make me ill, looking at you fish and nuts, I am willing to try it. Flavor networks. Candied ginger because it burns so good. I will eat all of the black licorice. All of it.

 I Spend a Lot of Time Thinking About 

Will humanity choose to save itself from itself? Architecture, diy, sustainable design, and reuse. I spend a fair amount of time thinking about art and the act of creating. I am seeking my own style. Hardware... nuts, bolts, screws, glue, epoxy, stain, varnish, wood, how to keep things together, and how to take things apart. Finding a group of people to buy a sizable parcel of land with that can then be used to create an intentional community that promotes sustainability without being a commune. Any idea that requires low start up capital, is worthwhile, recession proof, and can provide a stable income. Circular breathing and didgeridoos. Tools I want, but don't want to buy. Jam and things I can turn into jam. Beer and things I can turn into beer. Gardening, canning, and defeating the ravages of time just a little in the process. What time of year it is, what fruit, root, veggie, berry, or fungi is ripe, where to find it, and how to store it for the long term. Do I really trust my identification skills enough to eat that? Now that I have it...what am I going to do with it? Where did I put that thing?Trees. Autumn. Time and how to get more of it.

The Most Private Thing I'm Willing to Admit 

 I most often sit on the floor because most furniture is uncomfortable to me. I had this one chair once though. It was the perfect black leather mod armchair for sitting in with a tumbler of whiskey and listening to my records. I gave away the records and the chair when I came west. Whiskey has never been as good since.

838,t3_hzd8kh,Do you ever regret turning down a guy/girl?,"So I was dating this girl, only seen her 3 times. We had the best first date. Went out on a big road trip, hiked and spent the night at hers. At that stage I had doubts (I’m not very good when it comes to opening up) but I could tell at that stage she was interested.

After that, I think mentally I wasn’t in the best place due to work troubles. I saw her twice after that, both times with her friends but neither time was the same as the first, and I personally don’t think I gave the best impression of myself (not in a weird way, just a bit more insecure and quiet and probably not myself). I think that made me almost try too hard afterwards because I felt more vulnerable, but also not really admit any emotions.

She rejected my offer for another date this morning and said she wasn’t feeling it. That’s fine, I can move on. I’m going to see another girl I was dating tonight. 

In time I’ll forget about it, but part of me does think if we had that connection initially it’s such a shame that she feels that way right now.

She rejected my offer for another date this morning and said she wasn’t feeling it. That’s fine, I can move on. I’m going to see another girl I was dating tonight. 

In time I’ll forget about it, but part of me does think if we had that connection initially it’s such a shame that she feels that way right now. 

I’ve said my goodbyes and that’s that.

How often do people regret their decision? I just think it’s a shame really but life does go on."

852,t3_hxxea9,I've never felt more attractive as a straight man than surrounded by gay man.,"I think it's something that doesn't get spoken about too often but straight men often have a sexuality that is rarely if ever acknowledged in a positive way. Your male friends won't acknowledge it because of ingrained homophobia, your female friends won't acknowledge it because of a fear of giving unintentional signals. Generally, if I'm hearing about my sexuality or that of men like me, it's in a manner where it's spoken about negatively. I've found that even partners give less affirmation to me in relationships than they do to their female friends, despite us being the ones that have sex and date.

This paradigm is true everywhere except with gay men, who in my experience are not only willing to say my existence as a sexual being is okay but also something to be celebrated. In the handful of times I end up in primarily gay spaces a year I get more positive affirmation that I'm doing something right with my clothes, cologne, hair, etc. than I do from women throughout the rest of the year, even though I'm going on more than one date a week typically.

No real thesis, that's where the thought ends.

Also my search criteria was all people within 500 miles with no extra filters."
935,t3_hul600,[Tip] Women like it when you say their name,"Remember this isn't a silver bullet, you still have to not be a jerk and be kind, funny, honest and all the rest of that stuff.

But I've definitely found that just using her name as often as possible definitely has a positive effect. Both in person and in texts, take every opportunity to say her name.

Dunno why it works exactly but it's nice to have some easy to follow advice rather than the normal vague stuff you get usually!",OkCupid,"[Tip] Women like it when you say their nameRemember this isn't a silver bullet, you still have to not be a jerk and be kind, funny, honest and all the rest of that stuff.

I know it is probably meant to keep msg short, but anything over 2-3 lines and it is a fight to try and write or edit. The desktop, oof. Way oversized photos, can't see details, can't read profile and see photos at same time. Again, maybe just me, but I checked all my settings. Either way, not exactly a great user experience. And this doesn't even count all the messages no one sends and and the dates I am not getting, but this is likey just user error, not the app/site itself.",OkCupid,"InterfaceOKC user interface...not great, barely good, no?

944,t3_huw7ad,what am I missing,"I used to love OKC several years ago, but now it's like a bad mobile game where you have to wait 24 hours to do anything.  There are no search / sort options.  I can seemingly ""like"" about 10 people every 24 hours (which means it will take ages to go through all the people my age in the area.  And in order to message someone, you have to like them first, and if you've used those ten likes, you're screwed for 24 hours and will have a hard time finding them again.
