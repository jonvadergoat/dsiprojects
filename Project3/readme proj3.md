### The Data Science Process

**Problem Statement**
- Is it clear what the goal of the project is?
- What type of model will be developed?
- How will success be evaluated?
- Is the scope of the project appropriate?
- Is it clear who cares about this or why this is important to investigate?
- Does the student consider the audience and the primary and secondary stakeholders?

## Executive Summary

The stake holder is a new age dating app startup looking to build analytics into their users as they would like to match serious daters with people who are looking for long term commitment and match singles who are looking for fun with each other from the words they use. This is a billion dollar startup if it succeeds in solving the problem for matching people for love.
Coming in as a consultant , i advice them based on the models used to classify words based on NLP and  logistic regression models that classify them to accurately belong to more of a dating kind of person OKCUPID, or a casual dating /hookup kind of person TINDER based on the subreddits posts they come from.


TINDER is tradtionally a hookup app and casual dating app and Okcupid a more dating and long term dating app,

thus we are using the subreddits that talk about them to use it as a gauge if words used for long term dating and short dating can be trained to predict a model on unseen text from a person to see if hes actually in it for long term dating OKC camp or short term dating Tinder camp.
